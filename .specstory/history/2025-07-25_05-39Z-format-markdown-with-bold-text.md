# Format markdown with bold text (2025-07-25 05:39Z)

_**User**_

Better format the markdown here. Use bold text. Dont lose or add info

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to improve the formatting of the README.md file by adding bold text while not losing or adding any information. Let me look at the current content and see where I can add appropriate formatting with bold text to make it more readable and visually appealing.

Looking at the structure, I can see:
1. The title "SchemaOS" and tagline
2. Numbered sections with headers
3. Lists and bullet points
4. Tables/comparisons
5. Call to action
6. Commentary section

I should add bold formatting to:
- Section headers
- Key terms and concepts
- Important phrases
- Table headers
- Key benefits/features

Let me go through this systematically and add bold formatting where appropriate without changing any content.</details></think>

I'll improve the formatting of the README by adding bold text to make it more visually appealing and easier to read.

I'm reformatting the README to add bold text for better visual hierarchy and readability without changing any content.

- Task	Old Way	With SchemaOS
- Build Customer‑360 sync	Integrate 4 SaaS APIs, Dockerize Airflow, babysit DAG failures.	Draw 4 nodes → connect edges → hit “Deploy.” Copilot writes transformations; tests greenlight in CI.
- Prototype an RAG service	Stand up a vector DB, ETL docs, schedule re‑index job.	Add VectorIndex node; bind to Pinecone or pgvector; SchemaOS keeps index in sync automatically.
- Govern shadow pipelines	Chase rogue zaps/GSheets.	Replace them with a visible graph; RBAC & audit out‑of‑the‑box.
- Optimize infra spend	Manual profiling, reserved node sizing.	Edge Workers billed by ms; cost dashboard per edge, per pipeline.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully reformatted the README with better formatting by:

1. Making the title and tagline bold with proper heading hierarchy
2. Converting all section headers to proper markdown headers with bold formatting
3. Converting the comparison sections into proper markdown tables with bold headers
4. Adding bold formatting to key terms, concepts, and important phrases throughout
5. Making bullet points more visually distinct with bold leading terms
6. Adding proper separator for the commentary section
7. Making the final tagline bold for emphasis

The content remains exactly the same - no information was lost or added, just the formatting was improved to be more readable and visually appealing. The use of bold text helps create better visual hierarchy and makes key concepts stand out.</details></think>

I've successfully reformatted the README with better formatting by:

✅ **Added bold formatting to:**
- Section headers and titles  
- Key terms and concepts (like "graph‑defined contract", "Edge Workers", "type‑safe code", etc.)
- Important metrics ("~70%", "300 edge locations", "30‑minute demo")
- Feature names and benefits
- Table headers and important phrases

✅ **Improved structure with:**
- Proper markdown heading hierarchy (`#`, `##`)
- Clean markdown tables for comparisons
- Better visual separation with horizontal rule
- Enhanced readability through strategic bold text placement

✅ **Preserved all original content** - no information was lost or added, just made more visually appealing and easier to scan.

The README now has much better visual hierarchy and readability while maintaining all the original information and messaging.
