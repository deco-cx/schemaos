# Data Visualization Improvements âœ¨

## Style Fixes Applied

### 1. **Drawer Layout**
- Increased width: `sm:max-w-5xl lg:max-w-6xl` for better data visibility
- Proper padding structure with `p-6` for content areas
- Removed padding from SheetContent and added it to inner divs for better control

### 2. **Table Styling**
- Added shadow to table container: `shadow-sm`
- Improved header styling with bottom border
- Better hover states: `hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-gray-800/50`
- Added horizontal padding for first/last columns: `first:pl-6 last:pr-6`
- Lighter dividers between rows: `divide-gray-100`

### 3. **Text Contrast**
- Fixed pagination text from light gray to darker: `text-gray-600`
- Added `font-medium` to make text more readable
- Consistent color scheme throughout

## Data Views Feature

### Property Panel Enhancement
Added a new "Data Views" section that:
- **Only appears** for nodes with compatible capabilities
- **Shows available views** based on the binding's capabilities
- **Indicates future views** with disabled state and "coming soon" tooltips
- **Extensible design** ready for AI-generated views

### View Registry System (`view/src/lib/viewRegistry.ts`)
Created a flexible system for managing different data visualization types:

1. **Core Views**:
   - âœ… **Table View** - Currently implemented with full features
   - ðŸ”œ **Chart View** - For data trends (requires TimeSeries capability)
   - ðŸ”œ **Kanban Board** - For status-based organization (requires Assignable)
   - ðŸ”œ **Calendar View** - For time-based data
   - ðŸ”œ **Metrics Dashboard** - For KPIs and summaries

2. **Capability-Based Filtering**:
   - Views only show when node has required capabilities
   - Support for multiple capability requirements
   - Dynamic icon and description system

3. **AI Integration Ready**:
   - Structure for AI-generated custom views
   - Metadata for prompt tracking
   - Extensible view definition format

## Visual Hierarchy

The implementation creates a clear hierarchy:
1. **Primary Action**: Table View (currently available)
2. **Future Actions**: Other views shown but disabled
3. **Contextual Help**: Subtle text explaining AI can generate more views

## Benefits

1. **Discoverability**: Users can see what views are possible
2. **Context**: Clear connection between capabilities and available views
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new view types
4. **AI-Ready**: Foundation for AI-generated visualizations
5. **Professional Polish**: Improved spacing, contrast, and visual design

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Zustand for state management
- Leverages TypeScript for type safety
- Modular component structure
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
